# ABOUT THE PROJECT

This is a tiny navbar project.
It was created with the intention of practicing with CSS and React.
The data can be found in data.jsx. To make things interesting, react-icons are also saved here. Since the file is .jsx, it works!

The navbar is dynamic, and adapts to different screen dimensions. In addition, a toggle button is added to toggle on/off.
Animations were added to give the navbar a little life.
